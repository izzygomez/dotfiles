# Oh My Zsh configuration.
#
# TODO: I just realized it's *assumed* that oh-my-zsh is installed on any
# machine that uses this dotfiles repo, which may not be true. Fix this, either
# by enforcing oh-my-zsh is installed for rest of `~/.zshrc` file to load, or
# by setting up a fallback (& logging an appropriate error message).
#
# I deleted most of the commented out template lines that were not being used;
# see file in omz repo here:
# https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/templates/zshrc.zsh-template
#
# Note: I considered removing oh-my-zsh entirely as a dependency, but I quickly
# realized that it sets up a lot of nice things that I'd otherwise have to
# manually configure. For now I'm going to keep it, but note that no theme will
# be set here since I'm using the `pure` prompt (see next section).
#
# To be more explicit: the oh-my-zsh startup script loads in a bunch of lib
# files [1] that are extremely useful. This includes things like being able to
# `cd` without typing `cd`, having a `l` alias, git aliases, referencing parent
# directories with `.....`, and more that I haven't even discovered yet. Maybe
# in the future I can work towards removing oh-my-zsh as a dependency, but for
# now I'll just make it a bit more invisible by setting its update frequency to
# only happen every 60 days.
